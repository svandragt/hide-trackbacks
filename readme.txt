Requires at least: 3.1.2
Tested up to: 3.1.2
Stable tag: 1.0

Stops trackbacks and pingbacks from showing up as comments on posts. 

== Description ==

Have the benefits of track/ping backs (know when someone writes about posts) whilst keeping the comments clean and uncluttered. After enabling, trackbacks and pingbacks are no longer shown on your posts and the comment count is updated correctly to reflect this. You can still access them via the admin panel. NOTE: Might very well work on older WordPress versions (let me know).

== Installation ==
