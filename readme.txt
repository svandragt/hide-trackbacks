Prevents trackbacks and pingbacks from showing up as comments on posts.

== Description ==

Introducing *Hide Trackbacks* - keep the benefits of track- and pingbacks (know when someone writes about posts) while keeping the comments clean and uncluttered.

After enabling the plugin, trackbacks and pingbacks are no longer shown on your posts and the comment count is updated correctly to reflect this. They remain accessible via the admin panel.

Original code created by  [Honey Singh](http://www.honeytechblog.com/how-to-remove-tracbacks-and-pings-from-wordpress-posts/) (used with permission of the author).

== Installation ==

Install the plugin via the plugins tab in the admin area, or manually if you prefer:

1. Upload the `hide-trackbacks` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
